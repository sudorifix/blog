The style is adapted from the [So Simple Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/) developed by the Jekyll theming maestro [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/). The icon was sourced from [art shop](https://thenounproject.com/ariffajar190915/) via [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).
